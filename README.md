# The Contact List App 

Contact List App enhances contact management by fetching and displaying user data from the API, allowing users to effortlessly add new contacts, update existing ones, and efficiently remove contacts. This comprehensive feature set makes it an invaluable tool for organizing and maintaining a contact list, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Fetch and Display User Contacts: The React.js Contact List App is a powerful tool that fetches user data from the provided API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays it in an organized and user-friendly manner. The app utilizes the API to retrieve contact information, including names, emails, and phone numbers, and dynamically renders it on the interface. Users can effortlessly browse through the list of contacts, making it convenient to access essential information.

Seamlessly Add and Update Contacts: This Contact List App goes beyond just displaying contact details by enabling users to add and update contacts directly from the application. By leveraging the POST and PUT API calls, the app allows users to create and modify contact entries. Adding a new contact triggers a POST request to the API, which securely saves the contact information. Similarly, updating an existing contact triggers a PUT request, ensuring that the contact details are accurately reflected and stored in the API.

Efficient Contact Deletion: The React.js Contact List App provides a streamlined approach to contact management by implementing a reliable delete functionality. Users can easily remove contacts from the list by initiating a DELETE request to the API, even though it's a dummy call. This feature offers a seamless experience when organizing the contact list, ensuring that outdated or irrelevant entries can be swiftly removed from the system. The app guarantees the consistency and accuracy of the contact list by providing a hassle-free contact deletion process.
